# **WONDER Lite**
**Wave field synthesis Of New Dimensions of Electronic music in Realtime**

WONDER Lite is a stripped down version of the original *WONDER* suite 
developed by the Audiocommunication Group at TU Berlin.
Eugen Winter of HAW Hamburg updated and improved the codebase.

This package contains the following components of WONDER:

- **libwonder**: Library
- **cwonder**: Managing Application
- **twonder**: Rendering Application
- **xwonder**: GUI Control Application (needs some work)

## Installation on Ubuntu Linux
### PREPARATION

#### 1. Install a compiler and further development tools:
```
sudo apt-get install build-essential
```

#### 2. Install Meson build system:
```

sudo apt-get install meson pkg-config
```

#### 3. Install WONDER dependencies (libraries and header files) of libxml++2.6, libjack2, liblo, freeglut and Qt5:
```
sudo apt-get install libxml++3.0 libxml++3.0-dev libjack-jackd2-0 libjack-jackd2-dev liblo7 liblo-dev qt5-default
```

### BUILD / INSTALLATION

```
meson --buildtype release builddir
cd builddir
meson compile
sudo meson install 
```

## CONFIGURATION

|Files|Location|
|---    |---    |
|Starup Scripts |*/usr/share/wonder/scripts*|
|Configuration files|*/etc/wonder*|

### Application configuration files
*cwonder_config.xml:* Adjust projects path, number of sources and room geometry.

*twonder_config.xml:* Adjust speaker distance and focus radius.

### Speaker configuration files:
*twonder_speakerarray.xml*

or

*speakers/n101* and *speakers/n102*

### Node configuration files:
*cluster.conf:* Adjust username, IP address, JACK device, negative delay, etc.

*twonder_n101.conf:* Speaker array configuration of node 1 (n101).

*twonder_n102.conf:* Speaker array configuration of node 2 (n102).

### Important!!
Make shure to modify the configuration files (especially cluster.conf) properly! Otherwise the start-up scripts might fail!

## Work from HAW Hamburg
The speaker configuration files and start-up scripts are for the IÂ²AudioLab (https://i2audiolab.de) at the HAW Hamburg (https://haw-hamburg.de).
Several bugfixes and changes have been applied to the code base of WONDER version 3.1.9 at the HAW.
For a better portability the WONDER logging functionalities have been removed.
Platform dependend code parts (suchs as POSIX *sleep*) have been replaced by platform independant versions from the C++ STL.
The Qt4 dependencies of xwonder have been updated to Qt5.
The code can be compiled on Linux and Windows.

**Linux:** Tested with Ubuntu 17.10.

**Windows:** Tested with Windows 10 64-bit, MSYS2 and MinGW-w64 GNU compiler toolchain 64.

The SConstruct script for the compilation has been edited and compiles xwonder with Qt5 instead of Qt4 dependencies.

**Note:** A compilation of xwonder with the SConstruct script on a Windows platforms is not implemented yet.

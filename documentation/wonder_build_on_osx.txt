Building wonder on OSX:

Dependencies:

- Mostly available from macports:

  Make sure you have macports: http://www.macports.org/install.php
  (Make sure "port" is in your path --- maybe it's in /opt/local/bin and you already had a .bash_profile, so the macports installer's changes to your .profile didn't do anythin...)

  Install dependencies:
  # sudo port install scons liblo pkgconfig libxmlxx2

- Get from elsewhere:

  - Take jack from jackosx.com
  - Take Qt4 from qt website, and follow instructions there.  (http://qt.nokia.com/downloads/mac-os-cpp)

- Get the source to WONDER!
  http://swonder.sourceforge.net

Make sure you have the updated SConstruct file.  (The correct new one does not include "-march=native" in the CCFLAGS.)

cd to the top level of the wonder distribution

The following builds all the components that will build on OSX: (= wfs minus scoreplayer and xwonder)

We need to set the PKG_CONFIG_PATH and ensure that the PATH is set right.  This command is all one line:

PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/opt/local/lib/pkgconfig/:/usr/local/lib/pkgconfig/  PATH=$PATH:/opt/local/bin/ scons lib=1 jackpp=1 cwonder=1 twonder=1 jfwonder=1

# xwonder needs to be build separately for now:
cd src/xwonder/
qmake -spec macx-g++
make

cp -r xwonder3.app ../../bin/

# installing (as root)
# go back to the top level of the wonder distribution
cd ../../

# install (as root)
 PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/opt/local/lib/pkgconfig/:/usr/local/lib/pkgconfig/ PATH=$PATH:/opt/local/bin/ sudo scons install lib=1 jackpp=1 cwonder=1 twonder=1 jfwonder=1

There are speaker configuration files for the I²AudioLab (https://i2audiolab.de) at the HAW Hamburg (https://haw-hamburg.de).
Several bugfixes and changes have been applied to the code base of WONDER version 3.1.9 at the HAW.
For a better portability the WONDER logging functionalities have been removed.
Platform dependend code parts (suchs as POSIX *sleep*) have been replaced by platform independant versions from the C++ STL.
The Qt4 dependencies of xwonder have been updated to Qt5.
